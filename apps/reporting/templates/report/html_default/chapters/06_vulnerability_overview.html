            {{ REPORT_COMPANY_INFORMATION.name }} performed a Penetration Test for {{ project.client.name }}
            on {{ project.start_date|date }} - {{ project.end_date|date }}.

            This assessment utilized both commercial and proprietary tools for the initial mapping and reconnaissance of
            the network(s),
            as well as custom tools and scripts for unique vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the manual analysis, assessors attempted to leverage discovered vulnerabilities and test for key
            security flaws.
            The following vulnerabilities were determined to be of highest risk, based on several factors including
            asset criticality,
            threat likelihood, and vulnerability severity.

        <h3>Vulnerability Risk Definition and Criteria</h3>

        <p>
            The risk ratings assigned to each vulnerability are determined by averaging several aspects of the exploit
            and the environment, including reputation, difficulty,
            and criticality.
        </p>
        <table class="table-bordered">
            <tr>
                <th>Critical</th>
                <td>
                    Critical vulnerabilities pose a serious threat to an organization's security, and should be fixed
                    immediately.
                    They may provide a total compromise of the target environment, or similar critical impacts.

            <tr>
                <th>High</th>
                <td>
                    High risk vulnerabilities provide a serious risk to the company environment and should
                    be corrected promptly. These issues can significantly affect the organization's security
                    posture.

            <tr>
                <th>Medium</th>
                <td>
                    Medium severity vulnerabilities represent a moderate risk to the environment. They may
                    require additional context before remediation but should be remediated after critical
                    and high risks.

            <tr>
                <th>Low</th>
                <td>
                    Low severity vulnerabilities provide minimal risk to the target environment, and often
                    theoretical in nature. Remediation of low risks is often a lower priority than other
                    security hardening techniques.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Informational</th>
                <td>
                    Informational vulnerabilities have little-or-no impact to the target scope by themselves.
                    They are included however, as they may be a risk when combined with other
                    circumstances or technologies not currently in place. Remediation of informational items
                    is not necessary.

            The following vulnerabilities were found within each risk level.

            Risk level is depends upon the severity of the vulnerabilities found.
