# Permissions and Groups
Vulnman comes with the following default groups and permission levels:

`management`
:   The management group members are allowed to list projects and clients.
The management is allowed to create and update projects.

`pentester`
:   The members of the pentester group do not have any permission on default.
A member of the management group need to assign a pentester to a project.
A pentester is able to add content (e.g. vulnerabilities) to their projects.
