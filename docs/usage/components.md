## Vulnerability Templates
Vulnman creates your findings based on *vulnerability templates*.
These templates can be imported from external resources (YAML and Markdown files).


The import of the built-in templates can be done with the following command:
```
python manage.py import_vulnerability_templates
```


## Checklists
The checklists are templates for To Dos for your pentest.
Like vulnerability templates, these can be imported from YAML and Markdown files.

```
python manage.py import_checklists
```
