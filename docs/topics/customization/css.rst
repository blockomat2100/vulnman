===================
Customize CSS Theme
===================

Put your CSS theme in the ``static/css/themes`` directory.

The file name **must** end with ``min.css``.

Since `vulnman` is using `Bootstrap`, you can use any bootstrap theme you want.

To change the CSS theme you need to change ``VULNMAN_CSS_THEME`` setting in your :ref:`local_settings.py<introduction-configuration>` file.
