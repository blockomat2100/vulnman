# CSS-Theme

Put your CSS theme in the `static/css/themes` directory.

The file name **must** end with `min.css`.

Since `vulnman` is using [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/), you can use any bootstrap theme you want.

To change the CSS theme you need to change `VULNMAN_CSS_THEME` setting in your [settings file](../../getting_started/configuration/index.md).
